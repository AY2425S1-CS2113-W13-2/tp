## Design & implementation

# High Level Functionalities - Zackermax
![HighLevel.png](HighLevel.png)

**FitTrack** is the main class and entry point of the application.  
It manages high level functionalities by coordinating the `FitTrackLogger`, `Storage`, `User`, `Parser`, `Ui`, `TrainingSession`, and `Exercise` classes.

- **FitTrackLogger** manages logging for the application, ensuring errors and important events are properly recorded.
- **Storage** manages saving and loading data from a persistent storage file.
- **User** holds the userâ€™s information, such as age and gender, and provides methods to modify or retrieve this data.
- **Parser** handles parsing of user input, converting it into commands and actions.
- **Ui** manages all output and user interaction, such as printing data and messages to the console.
- **TrainingSession** represents a single training session, including exercises and metadata (like date and description).
- **Exercise** represents different types of exercises available in the application, like pull-ups or shuttle runs.
